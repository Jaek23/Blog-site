# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Blog-Site 

## Description 
This is the fourteenth challenge for the UTA boot camp. This project was created to make a blog post website using the MVC model. For this challenge, I was focused on creating a basic full-stack application with all the skills and knowledge gained throughout the course. This application allows users to create their accounts and make new blog posts and post them for other users to view and comment on. 

## Usage 
When users open up the Blog-Site application, there will be a navbar displayed with the option to log in/create an account. The user will have to either log in or create a new account if they don't have one to create and comment on other posts. Once the user has logged in they will be taken to the user dashboard page, where they will be able to create/edit posts. When the user is logged in and they go to their homepage, there will be a list of all posts created by different users where users will be able to click on any post and make comments about that specific post.
